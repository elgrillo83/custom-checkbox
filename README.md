# Custom Checkbox

## Summary

A custom-styled and accessible checkbox.

## Task

Using plain HTML, CSS, and JS (no third-party libraries and frameworks), create a styled checkbox that preserves the accessibility of a native checkbox (keyboard toggle). Use as little JS as possible/reasonable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The custom checkbox is styled similar to what you see in the video (find a checkmark SVG in Assets below).
- [ ]  Clicking the native checkbox, the custom checkbox is displayed and checked as well.
- [ ]  Clicking the custom checkbox, the native checkbox is checked as well.
- [ ]  Using the keyboard (tab), when the native checkbox is focused, a blue line appears around the custom checkbox.
- [ ]  Using the keyboard (tab), when the native checkbox has focus and the user presses space, the native checkbox is selected as well as the custom checkbox.
- [ ]  When hiding the native checkbox, the native accessibility (keyboard navigation: tab, space) is preserved for the custom checkbox.

## Instructions

- Open `index.html`
- To display the native checkbox, remove the `visually-hidden` CSS class.
